    * added checkbox in PsaiCoreManager to not destroy the psai instance between Scenes
    * fixed timing problems in case of high latencies / loading times
    * fixed problem of occasionally skipped Segments when starting from rest / silence
    * fixed nulled out soundtrack file in PsaiSoundtrackLoader Inspector
    * fixed psai Editor LE: Selection of AudioClips was only working if the soundtrack was residing in Assets/Resources
    * fixed: GetSampleCountByMilliseconds could give incorrect results if the milliseconds value * sampleRateHz value was greater than int.MaxValue
    * fixed an issue that could result in wrong playback timing for large audio clips
    * improved Couroutine handling
    * fixed wrong wake up from rest after StopMusic() had been called
    * changed: calling StopMusic when the music was already fading will override the original fade rather than ignoring the second fade

    * Demo overall cleanup
    

2016-05-13  1.7.2
    * psai now runs smoothly on WebGL
    * psai output can now be routed to any Audio Mixer Group, allowing to apply any combination of audio effects to your psai music.
    * minimized the playback latency when starting a Theme from silence
    * added three Demo-Scenes to get started quickly! You'll find them in the "Demos" folder.
    * added Tooltips to psai Editor Light, PsaiCoreManager, PsaiPlayerUi
    * fixed: broken fadeout when calling StopMusic(immediately)
    * changed: psai will now go to Silence Mode if no Last Basic Mood has been set    
    * added PsaiCore.SetLastBasicMood()    
    * the PsaiPlayer Ui no longer holds flags for toggling the UI elements. To switch elements off or on, just toggle corresponding sub-canvases 
        in the Psai GameObject directly
    * the PsaiDemoSoundtrack is now included in the psai Music Engine
    
    
2016-03-03  1.7.1
    * the "Resource" subfolder containing your soundtrack can now be places anywhere, e.g.
        "Assets/MySoundtrackFiles/Resources/MySoundtrack" would be a valid location.
    * cleaned up PsaiCoreManager, added psai Master Volume slider
    * fixed: the Log Level (the amount of logging information) can not be changed on-the-fly
    * further minimized memory allocation at runtime

    * fixed playback logic for Shock
    * fixed Psai.prefab UI not working outside the PsaiPlayer.scene
    * Trigger script rework
        * You can now not only trigger music Themes, but also let the music stop or return to the last Basic Mood 
            using any of the common Trigger scripts.
        * replaced PsaiStopMusic() by PsaiTriggerOnSignal()
        * removed PsaiGenericTrigger()
        * removed PsaiOneShotTrigger()
        * fixed PsaiTriggerOnButtonDown()

2015-07-23  1.6.1
    * we replaced the old PsaiPlayerUnity by a fancy new PsaiPlayer based on Unity's new UI system
    * you can now choose the fadeout time when calling PsaiStopMusic(immediately)

2015-05-07  1.6.0
    * dropped support for Unity versions < 5.0
    * fixed occasional timing problems in Unity 5
    * fixed: Unity was not immediately reflecting psai Project changes made in Psai Editor LE due to caching

2015-04-27  1.5.17
    * PsaiSoundtrackLoader will now load psai Project files directly by XML
    * No need to build the soundtrack after changes any more, just save your soundtrack.
        * To load, play or edit a former .psai project file, just rename it to .xml.
        * You can still load .psai files in the psai Editor, but make sure that no files of the same name exist in
            your soundtrack folder (e.g. "MySoundtrack.psai" and "MySoundtrack.xml" will cause problems at runtime,
            as Unity ignores the file extensions when loading from the Resources folder).
        * The binary .bytes file format is deprecated
    * dropped support for Unity versions < 4.6	
    * fixed wrong playback of MIDDLE-Segments after triggering the same Theme again while an END-Segment was playing
    * PsaiStopMusic now allows overriding the default resting time
    * soundtracks will no longer be unloaded between scene transitions if DontDestroyOnLoad() was called on the Psai.prefab
		
2015-02-12  1.5.16
    * fixed occasional timing problems and skipping of Segments on interrupting triggers
    * fixed Inspector for PsaiStopMusic not storing the selected Radiobutton ("by End / by fade-out")

2015-01-27  1.5.15
    * added Unity 5.0 compatibility
    * added a whole bunch of Trigger scripts that let you integrate and control a soundtrack in your game without any scripting!
        * PsaiOneShotTrigger
        * PsaiGenericTrigger
        * PsaiTriggerOnButtonDown
        * PsaiTriggerOnEnable
        * PsaiGoToRest	
        * PsaiStopMusic
        * PsaiReturnToLastBasicMood
    * introducing TriggerConditions: Just drag them on any GameObject that holds a Trigger component to further define when it should fire:

        * PsaiTcSkipIfComponentIsDisabled
        * PsaiTcSkipIfThemeTypeIsPlaying
    * PsaiSoundtrackLoader now supports Drag & Drop

2014-11-27  1.5.13
    * performance gain: psai now uses auto-generated wrapper-objects as a workaround for AudioClips not being streamed from disk. To have them created, just run the psaiMultiAudioObjectEditor on your soundtrack again.

    * optimized memory usage
